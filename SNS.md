> - The [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) becomes reality. The web becomes a drastically more personal thing. Users' data and exploration is under the users' control -- similar to how a "personal computer" is under the user's control, and "the cloud" is not. Users decide which apps and other people get access to their data. Explorations can be recorded for the user in memex fashion. The user gets to keep copies of all the data they have observed through the web. A self-archiving personal record forms, which the user can always go back to, explore, and use -- whether or not those applications are still in development by their authors.

### Decision Making Principles

- Separation of Data(Information) and App(Tool)
- Personalization in command
- Emphasis of Individual
- Focus of Control and Ownership
- Ease of Accessibility
- Diversity via customization
- Offline-first, Online-on-demand
- Distributed(Peer2Peer) Gathering


# _Philosophy_

- `Space(time)` is an integral existence where life(live, play, work, ...) takes place
- Live, work, play ... are all essential parts of `life`, better to be integrated harmoniously
- `Home` is here and now, local, not somewhere else
- `We` would like to visit homes from each other, mindfully, embracing all kinds of diversities
- The more `diversities` there are, the richer life ever will be
- `Everyone` is unique, we are all the same
